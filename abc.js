A life coach is someone who counsels and encourages clients through personal or career challenges. A life coach helps guide clients to reach their ultimate goals. 
A life coach can help individuals in different areas of their life. But because each human being is different, so will their goals. Oftentimes, a life coach counsels clients in personal and professional arenas. This means career, personal development, relationships, nutrition, divorce, grief, and even financial wellness.
What does a life coach do? 
It’s important to understand the role a life coach plays. And a lot of the time, that comes down to personalized goals. At BetterUp, our coaches work with members to create personal and professional development goals.

Is life coaching and therapy the same thing? In short, no. But there are some similarities. While life coaching and therapy are both focused on improving people’s well-being, there are distinct differences. Therapists require certain educational and license prerequisites to provide mental health care treatment.
